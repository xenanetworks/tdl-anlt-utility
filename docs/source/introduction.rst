Introduction
============

Xena AN/LT Utility is an application that provides users with a command-line user interface to do interactive testing (e.g. AN/LT testing). It provides a set of CLI commands to manage and configure test ports, collect statistics, and save logs. Xena AN/LT Utility uses `tdl-xoa-driver <https://pypi.org/project/tdl-xoa-driver/>`_ to communicate with Xena testers.

Auto-Negotiation and Link Training
------------------------------------

Auto-Negotiation and Link Training (:term:`AN/LT`) provides functions to help you fine-tune the protocol to its optimal state, test interoperability between different vendors, and protocol compliance for different implementations.

Auto-negotiation (:term:`AN`) was originally designed for Ethernet over twisted pair up to 1G. Beyond exchanging speed capabilities for the link participants, AN has evolved for today's Ethernet to include additional configuration information for establishing reliable and consistent connections. AN allows the devices at the end points of a link to negotiate common transmission parameters capabilities like speed and duplex mode, exchange extended page information and media signaling support. At higher speeds and signaling the choice of FEC may be relevant. It is during auto negotiation the end points of a link share their capabilities and choose the highest performance transmission mode they both support.

Once the ports in the link have completed the requisite AN information exchange and reached agreement, the link partners move to the next step, link training (LT), the exchange of Training Sequences. This is essential to tune the channels for optimal transmission. During link training the two end points of the link will exchange signals.

.. rubric:: No Auto Negotiation, No Link Training

In some instances, Auto Negotiation and Link Training are not required to establish a communication path: High speed optical transceivers and interfaces typically only run at one speed, so there is no need the negotiate this.

Link Training is only required for electrical interfaces - in some cases (e.g. when short cables are used) an electrical interface may become operational just using default settings of the terminal equipment in the communication path. The IEEE 802.3 by specification allows for force connect over electrical interfaces in these instances.

While Link Training can be essential to make some electrical interfaces work, Auto Negotiation may not be required, if the link speed is fixed or if it can be manually set at both end points of a link.

.. rubric:: Auto Negotiation and Link Training

Auto Negotiation and Link Training are in principle two **independent** processes. However, when both are to be done, Auto Negotiation must start first to determine the overall mode for a link and then the Link Training. Hereby you get the sequence shown in the figure below.
